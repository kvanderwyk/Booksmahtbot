## Booksmahtbot

Universal Bookstore is a small e-commerce platform with legendary customer service. Its Customer Success department is preparing for a launch of a huge new product line, and wants to make sure their reputation won’t be impacted. They want you to triage customer inquiries and automate responses as much as possible, handing off cases to support reps only when necessary.

### Requirements

- Support reps indicate customer requests to a bot-like component in the Utility Bar (**Bonus**: Make the bot available directly to customers)
- Ensure a customer’s identity is verified before their request is handled
- When a customer requests to put a shipment on hold, provide options for pickup based on the customer’s location, and automatically notify the customer when the order is ready for pickup
- Customers are routed to create a Case when their intent cannot be confidently determined or their sentiment is mostly negative (**Bonus**: Prepopulate the Case with the customer’s intent and known information)

### Supported Learning

- Lightning Components
